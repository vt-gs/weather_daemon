#
# YAML mesage definition file for the VTGS weather daemon/monitor.
# Messages are defined here as an unnamed list of dictionaries.  Each
# entry (dictionary) must specify the message routing key, time delay
# (inter-message time) in seconds, and the list of keys tht will be
# included in each message.
# DANGER: Make note of the leading "-" which defines each entry in the
# list.  Without that, the file will not parse.
# REVIEW:DANGER: There is no checking of keys performed in the daemon
# code.  If a key is specified here that doesn't exist in the data
# extraction code (see davisethernet/read.py) the daemon will probably
# crash and/or throw an infinite number of error messages.
# REVIEW: This is a first cut at a structure for message definition.
# it probably could be made better (but do we need to?)
